## Final project - Money Detection

By using a basic webcam, calibrating it to detect stationary coins that appeared in front of it and using this algorithm, this project was able to detect and calculate the value of the coins by getting the approximate radius of the coins. (Results were not super accurate, should consider using a better camera).
